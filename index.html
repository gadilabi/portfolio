			<p>
				My name is Gad Laviod and I am a 32 years old self taught full stack web developer.
				<br><br>
				Programming has been a hobby of mine for about a decade, but it was 2 years ago when I first started learning web development.
				I set out to create a website for my tutoring business and ended up developing not only a website but a passion for the field.
